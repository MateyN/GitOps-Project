GitOps Project

1. Optimize rgCreateUpdate.py Script:

Current State: The script uses the entire configuration and iterates over all realms, which is not necessary for small changes in specific realms.

Proposed Change: Modify the script to accept realms as parameters. This allows for realm-specific configuration files, making the process faster and more efficient.

2. Use Azure CLI Agent to Set Up Python Environment:

Task: Utilize an Azure CLI agent to build the required Python environment for the script execution during the pipeline run. This ensures the necessary dependencies are installed and configured automatically as part of the pipeline.

3. Sync pors-azure Project in Pipeline:

Task: Ensure that the pors-azure project repository is synchronized within the pipeline. This could involve cloning the repository, pulling the latest changes, or any other necessary sync operations.

4. Add Pipeline Parameters:

Task: Introduce new parameters to the pipeline configuration to specify:
Teams Name: The name of the team responsible or associated with the changes.
Realm: The specific realm to be targeted by the script.

5. Bonus Task - Trigger Pipeline Externally with Payload:   

Task: Enable the pipeline to be triggered from an external source, providing a payload that includes necessary parameters. This could involve setting up webhooks, API endpoints, or other mechanisms to initiate the pipeline run with dynamic inputs.
